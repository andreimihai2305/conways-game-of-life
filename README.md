# Conway's Game of Life

## Basic implementation of "Conway's game of life"

I've written this using Python, it follows the basic rules of conway's game of life but it's missing the part where cells are generated infinitely so the cells are limited to the width and height of the window.

Usage: 
- Clicking on a cell toggles its state
- Pressing enter on the keyboard starts / stops the game
- Pressing the 'r' key while the game is stopped resets all cells
